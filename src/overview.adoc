== Architecture Overview and Threat Model

Virtualization platforms are typically comprised of several components including
platform firmware, host OS, VMM, and the actual workload (typically in a VM)
that run on them. A monolith Supervisor Domain exists with the host OS/VMM
including device drivers and services forming the Trusted Computing Base (TCB).
This model is well established, but the downside is that most platform
components are in the TCB.
This aspect is ill-suited for confidential computing workloads that rely on
hardware-attested Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), and strive to minimize
the software and hardware TCB.

This specification describes the CoVE architecture which enables a new class
of hardware-attested trusted execution environment called TEE Virtual Machines
(TVMs). The TVMs are supported by a hardware-rooted, attestable TCB and its
execution state and memory are run-time-isolated from the host OS/VMM and other
platform software not in the TCB of the TVM. TVMs are protected from a broad
set of software-based and hardware-based threats per the threat model described
in <<threatmodel>>. The architecture describes an isolated (Confidential)
Supervisor Domain to enforce TCB and confidentiality properties, while using an
isolated (Hosting) Supervisor Domain for the host domain, thus maintaining the
OS/VMMs role as the resource manager (for both legacy VMs and TVMs).

On processors supporting multiple supervisor domains (the Smmtt extension), the
resources managed by the hosting supervisor domain (OS/VMM) include memory, CPU,
I/O resources and platform capabilities required to host the TVM workload. The
terms hosting supervisor domain and OS/VMM are used interchangeably in this
specification. The underlying memory isolation mechanism for supervisor domains
(Smmtt) is agnostic of the number of supervisor domains. On processors that do
not support multiple supervisor domains where Smmtt is not mandated, a single
confidential  supervisor domain and a single hosting supervisor domain can be
supported using other hardware memory isolation techniques like PMP
(for example <<dep3>>, other deployment models are also possible).

As shown in <<dep1>>, the Confidential Supervisor Domain is managed by software
that operates in HS-mode and manages resources granted to it by the Hosting
Supervisor Domain Manager (the OS/VMM). The Confidential Supervisor Domain
Manager is called the " *TEE Security Manager* " or *(TSM)* and acts as the
trusted intermediary between TEE and non-TEE workloads on the same platform.
The TSM should have a minimal hardware-attested footprint. The TCB (which
includes
the TSM and hardware) enforces strict confidentiality and integrity security
properties for workloads in this supervisor domain. The Root Domain Security Manager,
also called the " *TSM-driver* ", isolates the Confidential Supervisor Domain
from all other Supervisor domains and other platform components
(non-confidential and
confidential). The responsibility of the TSM is to enforce the security
objectives accorded to TEE workloads (TVMs) assigned to that supervisor domain.
The VMM is expected to continue to manage the security for non-confidential
workloads, and importantly the resource-assignment and scheduling management
functions for all confidential and non-confidential workloads.
Note that CoVE implementations may partition the TSM and TSM-driver
functionality as required by implementations. For example <<appendix_d>> shows
the TSM and  TSM-driver functionality in a single deployment unit.

CoVE supports models with dynamic resource allocations, where compute resources,
such as memory, start off as traditional untrusted resources owned by the
non-confidential/hosting supervisor domain, and are expected to be donated/
transitioned to the confidential supervisor domain via application binary
interface (ABI) supported by the TSM. Once the conversion process is complete,
TSM may assign confidential memory to one or more TVMs.
A converted confidential resource may be freely assigned to another TVM within
the same supervisor domain when it is no longer in use. However, an
unused confidential resource must be explicitly reclaimed for use in the
non-confidential supervisor domain (such memory conversions are tracked and
enforced via the TSM in the owning supervisor domain to enforce isolation
properties). The hosting supervisor domain may use the reclaimed memory
for itself or for non-confidential VMs.

Each TVM's address space can be comprised of confidential and non-confidential
regions. The former may include measured pages (that are part of the initial
TVM payload) and confidential zero-pages that can be mapped-in on demand by
the VMM following runtime accesses by the TVM. These zero'ed confidential pages
are pages that are demand-paged in and are expected to be zero'ed by the TSM to
prevent attacks from the host software on the TVM. The TSM also enforces that
the host does not overlap them with the existing (present) G-stage mappings for
the TVM. The non-confidential TVM-defined regions include those for shared-pages
and memory-mapped I/O (MMIO).

The TSM implements ABI that are accessed by the OS/VMM in the Hosting Supervisor
Domain Manager via a *Trusted Execution Environment Interface (TEEI)*. This ABI
is invoked via a *TSM-Driver* that operates in the M-mode privilege level on the
hart. The TSM itself operates in HS-mode (priv=01; V=0) of the hart and enables
the OS/VMM (also in HS-mode) to create TVMs, assign resources to TVMs, manage,
execute and destroy a TVM - _this specification aims to describe the TEEI and
TSM interfaces_. By using the Hypervisor extension of the RISC-V privileged
specification <<PRIVISA>>, this specification minimizes ISA changes to introduce
a scalable architecture for hosting TEE workloads. More than one confidential
supervisor domain may be hosted by the TSM-driver. Similarly, more than one
TVM may be hosted by the host OS/VMM via confidential supervisor domains.
Each TVM may consist of the guest firmware, a guest OS and applications. The
software components included in the TVM are implementation specific.

<<dep1>> shows the deployment model in which the TSM-driver runs in M-mode and
TSM runs in HS-mode. Systems without Smmtt or the requirement for multiple
supervisor domains can combine the functions of the TSM-driver and TSM in
M-mode, see <<appendix_d>>.
When supervisor domains are in use, the TSM-driver is in the TCB of all
supervisor domains and hence in the TCB for all CoVE workloads hosted on the
platform. The TSM-driver, which always operates in M-mode, uses the hardware
capabilities to provide:

* Isolation of memory associated with TEEs (including the TSM). We describe
*Confidential memory* as memory that is subject to access-control,
confidentiality and integrity suitable per threat model for CoVE components.
For Supervisor Domain memory isolation, the Smmtt extension may be used for
deployment scenarios where the TSM is at the same privilege level as the VMM.
The TEEI operations for memory management are described in detail below.
* Context switching of the hart supervisor domain id and MTT on TEECALL/TEERET
synchronous transitions or asynchronous transitions (due to interrupts).
* A machine agnostic ABI as part of the TEEI, to allow lower privileged
software to interact with the TSM-driver in an OS and platform agnostic manner.

The TSM-driver delegates parts of the TEE management functions to the TSM,
specifically isolation across confidential memory assigned to TVMs. The TSM is
designed to be portable across RISC-V platforms (that support CoVE) and interact
with the machine specific capabilities in the platform through the TEEI. The TSM
provides an ABI to the OS/VMM which has two aspects. First, a set of host ABIs
known as *COVH* that includes functions to manage the lifecycle of the TVM, such
as creating, adding pages to a TVM, scheduling a TVM for execution, etc., in an
OS/platform agnostic manner. Second, the TSM also provides an ABI to the TVM
contexts:
A set of guest ABIs known as *COVG* that enables the TVM workload to request
attestation functions, memory management functions, or paravirtualized IO.

In order to isolate the TVMs from the host OS/VMM and non-confidential VMs,
the supervisor domains (that contain the TSM state) must be isolated first.
This is achieved by enforcing isolation for memory assigned to the supervisor
domain that the TSM occupies. This memory region is called *TSM-memory-region*
and is expected to be a static region of memory that holds the TSM code and
data. It must be access-controlled from all software outside the TCB (e.g.,
using Smmtt or PMP), and may be additionally protected against physical access
with help of cryptographic mechanisms.

Access to the TSM-memory-region and execution of code from the
TSM-memory-region (for the TSM ABIs) is enforced in hardware via the maintenance
of the execution context (ASID, VMID and SDID) maintained per hart. This context
is enabled per-hart via the TEECALL interface to context switch into the
confidential supervisor domain context via the TSM-driver and disabled
via the TEERET interface to context restore to the hosting supervisor domain.
Access to TEE-assigned memory is allowed for the hart when access is
permitted as per the active permissions enforced by the memory management unit
(MMU) for the supervisor domain active on the hart (enforced through Sv and
Smmtt for CoVE). This per-hart execution context is used by the processor to
enforce access-control properties on memory accessed by TEE workloads managed by
the TSM. The details of the supervisor domain access protection is specified in
the Smmpt specification <<RVISD>>.

TSM functionality should be explicitly limited to support only the security
primitives to ensure that the OS/VMM and non-confidential VMs do not violate
the security of the TVMs through the resource management actions of the
OS/VMM. These security primitives require the TSM to enforce TVM virtual-hart
state save and restore, as well as enforcing invariants for memory assigned
to the TVM, including G-stage translation. The host OS/VMM provides the
typical VM resource management functionality for memory, IO, and VM's lifecycle
management.

<<dep1>> shows TVMs (a.k.a. confidential VMs) managed by a VMM and <<dep1a>>
shows Confidential applications managed by an untrusted host (OS/VMM). As
evident from the architecture, the difference between these two scenarios is the
software TCB (owned by the tenant within the TVM): for the tenant workload in the
application TEE case, a minimal guest runtime may be used; whereas in the VM TEE
case, an enlightened guest OS is expected in the TVM TCB. Other software models
that map to the VU/VS modes of operation are also possible as TEE workloads.
Importantly, the hardware mechanisms needed for both cases are identical, and
can be supported with the CoVE ABI.

The detailed architecture is described in the Section <<refarch>>. Note that the
architecture described above may have various implementations (e.g., see
<<appendix_c>> and <<appendix_d>>).
However, the goal of this specification is to propose a reference architecture
and ratify a normative CoVE ABI for TVMs as a RISC-V non-ISA specification.
