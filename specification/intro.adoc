== Introduction

This document describes the Confidential VM Extension (CoVE) interface for
a scalable Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for hardware virtual-machine-based
workloads on RISC-V-based platforms. This CoVE interface specification enables
application workloads that require confidentiality to reduce the Trusted
Computing Base (TCB) to a minimal TCB, specifically, keeping the host OS/VMM
and other software outside the TCB. 
% Do we want to talk here about IO devices as well?
The proposed specification supports an
architecture that can be used for Application and Virtual Machine workloads,
while minimizing changes to the RISC-V ISA and privilege modes.
% What is the meaning of "Application" here? When I read "Application and Virtual Machine" I think of a "process-based" and "VM-based" TEEs, i.e., SGX and TDX like. But this contradicts the initial sentence in this paragraph that says that CoVE provides TEE for VM-based workloads.
